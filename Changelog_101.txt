==========GoodMod Changelog ver 1.0.1==========
===============================================

Hello! C7meteors here to tell you about some changes to the GoodMod competitive L4D2 config. 
There was no official announcement for the config either, so I will be taking this opportunity 
to introduce the configs and the idea behind it.

The idea behind GoodMod is purely to balance the game, specifically to give survivors more of
an opportunity to reach saferoom. At the same time while doing this I wanted to reward infected
players for coordinating hits correctly so as not to make infected play useless without a quad
cap. Just reaching saferoom should not be enough to win the game though, so I also want to reward
better survivor play by preserving the HB/DB system, but still allowing the losing team to make the
map.

===============================================
With all that said, I feel like version 1.0 was a step in that direction; but as with any new thing,
had a few tweaks that could stand to be made. So here is the official changelog for version 1.0.1!
===============================================

	Godframes(spitter):
-I wanted to reward infected for being able to combo hitting spitter with any capper, instead of
	only relying on a hunter or charger. However this change ended up allowing spitters to
	free spit anything and get rewarded for it. I am adjusting the initial tick delay for
	spit from 0.2 to 0.3

	Spitter Damage:
-With the change to godframes on spitter, even with increasing the initial delay for spit damage
	the spitter is a lot stronger than necessary. I am removing the alternate 2/3 damage per
	tick so spitter will now do a consistant 2 damage per tick.

	Ammo:
-The idea behind the ammo increase was to allow survivors a bit of breathing room if there was a
	late tank fight without any ammo spawns. However current starting ammo counts were way to
	generous. I am reducing the shotgun ammo limit to 88, and SMG ammo to 750.

	Tank Melee Nerf:
-Initial tank melee nerf was reduced to 10 percent, however this results in melee's very quickly
	shredding the tank without much to counter. Melee nerf is increased to 17%.

	Weapon Spawns:
-Unsilenced uzi does too much damage, and pump shotgun cant kill anything. I'm dumb and don't know
	how to delete them completely, but I can further increase the number of suzi and chrome
	spawns (xD).

	Jump rocks:
-Jk I'm keeping jump rocks enabled. Play hard, meme harder

===============================================
That's all for patch 1.0.1! Thank you to everyone helping me with testing the config, and to anyone
who wants to give it a try, feel free to clone this repo and tell me what you think!

Catch you on the flipside
