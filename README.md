# GoodMod
 
Full credit to Sirpls for creating zonemod and helping me along with setting up my own server for L4D2. I am building GoodMod as a personal project with Zonemod as my template as I have not messed with anything with confogl before.

Version 1 will be a continuation of this template and I do plan for a version to where I build the entire config by scratch, but this repo will be here to track any changes to the current config. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!
