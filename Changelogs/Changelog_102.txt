===============================================
==========GoodMod Changelog ver 1.0.2==========
=============="Look! We got guns!"=============
===============================================

I've spent a lot of time focusing on infected play without touching too much on the survivor side.
Here's a patch that involves some tweaks to our current weapon stats, as well as some infected
tweaks as well!

===============================================

	Pump Shotgun:
-Because I am still dumb and do not know how to remove the pump shotgun, I am modifying it slightly
	to make it better to use. Chrome is still going to be the objectively better gun, but
	pump will at least be better to use for damage.
		-Damage remaining at 14 per pellet
		-Number of pellets fired reduced to 18 from 20
		-Scatter x reduced to 3.8 from 4.25
		-Scatter y reduced to 3.8 from 4.25

	Silenced SMG:
-I'm not sure that I agree with the current state of SMG's. The silenced appears to be using the
	default damage value (25) which is higher than unsilenced, but the spread is much larger.
	Typically a silenced weapon should be more accurate at the cost of doing less damage.
	The following values are changing for the silenced SMG:
		-Spread per shot reduced to 0.1 from 0.32
		-Max spread when moving reduced to 0.9 from 2.15
		-Damage fall-off distance increased from 0.79 to 1.2
		-Damage decreased to 19 from 25

	Unsilenced SMG:
-Small tweaks to the unsilenced SMG spread:
		-Spread per shot reduced to 0.2 from 0.26
		-Max spread when moving reduced to 1.45 from 1.85		

	Jump rocks:
-After much feedback regarding jump rocks (mostly blake hehehe) I will be disabling jump rocks once
	again. The goal with GoodMod is not to be a meme but to be a balanced config that will allow
	players a better chance to survive each map. Jump rocks will accomplish the opposite of that,
	so they will be gone now.
		-RIP jump rock revival, 2020-2020

	Spitter Damage:
-Even after nerfing spit damage in 1.0.1, free spit is still very strong and hard to counter play.
	I want to preserve the idea of comboing spit with SI other than Hunter/Charger, but to do
	this effectively I feel like another nerf is necessary so that infected isn't going out of
	their way to save spit. Spit damage will now be alternating 1-2 damage per tick.

	Common limit:
-Everyone keeps complaining about this thing I already lowered, so I'm lowering it again.
		-Common limit reduced to 18 from (the already reduced) 20
		-Natural horde reduced to 35 from (again already reduced) 40

===============================================
That's everything for patch 1.0.2! I do have plans to reach out to other members of the community in
regards to more of the scripting side, because there are changes I want to make to Jockey's to make
them more balanced in my opinion, so definitely stay tuned for future changes. I'm doing my best I'm
just not very smart yet h a h a.

Again thank you to everyone who is helping me test out these changes. Feel free to download this repo
and slap it in your server if you want to give it a try. Full credit to SirPlease for laying the
groundwork and developing ZoneMod and making it easy to modify.

Catch you on the flipside
